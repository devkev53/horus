Horus is the base name for this project, which is a web application to control sales of spare parts and services for a mechanical workshop.

It was required by a small workshop which wanted to control the flow of income, as well as the inventory of the products or spare parts they used in each service.

## üìñ Installation
#### Download this repository

> It is recommended to use a virtual environment for the installation of dependencies..!

- virtualenwrapper
```bash
mkvirtualenv (name env)
```

- virtualenv/venv
```bash
python -m venv (name env)
```
> Activation of the virtual environment
- virtualenwrapper
```bash
workon (name env)
```

- virtualenv/venv
```bash
(name env)\Scripts\activate
```

> **Installing the dependencies**
To install the dependencies, you must locate them at the **requirements.txt** file level and run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> **Performing Database Migrations**
Run database migrations

This command prepares the migrations to create the tables in the database
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
The migrate command generates the migrations in the database by creating the tables
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

##### Create a new user
To create a new user in the application it is necessary to run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> To set up the server we must be at the level of the **manage.py** file
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
> Having our database with its tables, it is necessary to create a superuser with the following command:
```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
It will ask us for the:
- username
- email
- name
- lastname
- password
- repeat the password
If everything is ok it will show the following message

#### Run the server and launch üöÄ the web application üíª
If everything worked correctly it should show that the application is running showing the address and port.

##### Enter Sale
The sales record is one of the fundamental parts for the application since it is one of the controls by which its development was carried out.
<img src="./imgs/Sale.png" style="border-radius: 12px" alt="Enter Sale" />

##### Shopping
Purchasing is where we manage the inventory of the products, and it is a fundamental part of the application since if there are no registered purchases we will not have stock and the sale cannot be made.
